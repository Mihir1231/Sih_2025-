              The institute has started an additional MBA program within the Engineering College from the academic year 2006-07.

This institute of professional education is housed in the sprawling 10-acre campus situated in picturesque locales of Gandhinagar. Right from their inception this institute sincerely committed itself to the cause of professional education and hence has spread no efforts to create an academic environment conducive to effective learning. In fact, the institute possesses all relevant and necessary infrastructural facilities right from its inception.

To this end, the institute has taken certain concrete and positive initiatives in molding the studentâ€™s attitudes towards their work, towards others and most importantly, towards themselves. The attitudes would distinguish them from the others, help them to be humble, to be open to change yet be prudent enough to judge when and which change is for better.
